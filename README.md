# Northcoders News API

Welcome to my News API!

To connect locally to the test and development databases:

1. Create a file called .env.test
2. In .env.test - add PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
3. Create a file called .env.development
4. In .env.development - add PGDATABASAE=nc_news

This will add the correct database name for each environment.
